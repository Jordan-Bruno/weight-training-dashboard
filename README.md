## About

This project is a personal dashboard built to help me track my weight training progress. After turning 30, I decided to start taking my health and fitness more seriously. My goal is simple: to grow stronger slowly and steadily, avoid injury, and improve my overall quality of life.

This dashboard gives me a clear visual summary of my workouts and showing my strength progression, highlighting personal bests, and storing full training logs. It helps me stay consistent and focused on long-term improvement.

- Date lookup to review full workout logs
- Reasonably Mobile-friendly responsive layout (Not recommended)
